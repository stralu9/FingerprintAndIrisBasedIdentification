# FingerprintAndIrisBasedIdentification

This project aims to implement and test a keypoint-based fingerprint and iris recognition system.

Fingerprint scores are obtained using local, global and hybrid (a fusion of local and global score) features, while local
matches are applied to determine iris scores.

The final part of the report is about how to fuse the two systems together
to obtain better results.
